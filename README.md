# Ontology Driven Recommender System for Homeopathy

## üìã Project Overview
This is a web-based application that recommends suitable **homeopathic medicines** based on user-input symptoms. It uses **semantic web technologies**, including OWL/RDF ontologies and SPARQL queries, to map symptoms to treatments intelligently. The system is built using **Java**, **JSP**, and **Apache Jena**, and deployed on **Apache Tomcat**.

## üîß Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool/Technology | Role in the Project |
|------------------|---------------------|
| **Ontology (OWL/RDF)** | Stores structured medical knowledge, defining relationships between symptoms, diseases, and treatments. |
| **SPARQL** | Queries the ontology to fetch relevant medicines, dosage, and duration. |
| **HTML & CSS** | Builds a clean, responsive frontend interface for user input and displaying results. |
| **Java (JSP, Servlets)** | Handles business logic, integrates Apache Jena, and dynamically renders treatment results. |
| **Maven** | Manages project structure and dependencies like Apache Jena. |
| **Apache Tomcat** | Deploys and runs the Java web application locally or on a server. |

**Execution Steps**
Follow these steps to run the Ontology Driven Recommender System for Homeopathy locally:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone or Download the Project

Clone the repository using:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <your-repo-link>
or download the ZIP and extract it.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Open in IDE

Open the project in Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or any IDE that supports Maven and Java Web Projects.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Check Project Structure

Make sure the following are properly placed:

ontology.owl (your OWL/RDF file) is in the correct resource path.

pom.xml has required dependencies (Apache Jena, Servlet API).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Apache Tomcat

Add Apache Tomcat server in your IDE.

Deploy the project on the Tomcat server.

Make sure the web.xml is configured correctly if needed.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Project

Use Maven to build:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install
Ensure there are no build errors.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Server

Start the Apache Tomcat server from your IDE.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Application

Open a web browser and go to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8080/<your-project-name>/
Example: http://localhost:8080/HomeopathySystem/

8Ô∏è‚É£ Test the System

Enter a symptom (e.g., Headache) in the input form.

Submit the form.

The system will run a SPARQL query on the ontology and display:

Suggested medicine

Dosage

Duration

Pricing

‚úÖ Done!
Your Homeopathic Medicine Recommendation System is now up and running!
